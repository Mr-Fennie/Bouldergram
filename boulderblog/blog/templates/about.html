          <h3 class="display-5">What is Bouldergram?</h3>
          <p>First and foremost, at the moment it is a prototype social media site that intends to connect climbers and build community by sharing route information and beta with other climbers.
                          It was created by Philip Joubert in May of 2021 as a passion project with the hope of creating a digital library of climbing routes that anyone can
                          access for free. It is a climbing photo blog for climbers, by climbers.</p>
          <br>    <h3 class="display-5">What does Bouldergram aim to be?</h3>
          <p>The only aim is to create resources that other climbers could potentially find useful.
                          As it stands, the site is still in its developmental stage and hopes to add a lot more
                          functionality to help any climber to get out there and send some projects! Of course,
                          the site can only develop and improve with the help of a willing community.</p>
          <br>    <h3 class="display-5">Future Functionality:</h3>
          <p>-Uploading/Editing multiple images and video files.
            <br>-Map locations to pinpoint routes/crags
            <br>-More categories/regional support
            <br>-Editing/Deleting comments
            <br>-View for all posts with similar tags
            <br>-More selections for posts (required gear, type of climb, etc.)
          </p>
